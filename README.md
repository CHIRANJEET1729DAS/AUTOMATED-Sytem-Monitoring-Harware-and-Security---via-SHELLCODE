# Project Title: Automated System Monitoring and Alerting Mechanism

 # Project Overview

This project implements an Automated System Monitoring and Alerting Mechanism that tracks critical system parameters such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network activity, and more on a Linux-based system. The system generates logs for various resources and automatically triggers email alerts when predefined thresholds are exceeded. The alerts are sent using the mailx utility to notify users about critical system conditions. This ensures that system administrators or users are promptly informed and can take necessary actions to maintain system performance.

 # Objectives

1)Continuous Monitoring: Monitor system parameters such as CPU, memory, disk space, and network usage, ensuring that critical values are logged for analysis.
2)Automated Alerts: Automatically send email notifications when system parameters exceed predefined thresholds.
3)Log Collection: Consolidate log data from different monitoring scripts to provide an overview of the system's health.
4)Efficient Notification System: Use mailx to send concise and informative email alerts, ensuring rapid responses to potential issues.
 
 # Core Features

**System Resource Monitoring:**

1)CPU Monitoring: Tracks the CPU usage over time, including process-level information to identify resource hogs or potential spikes.
2)Memory Monitoring: Monitors system memory usage to detect memory leaks or excessive usage that could impact system stability.
3)Disk Usage Monitoring: Tracks disk space utilization, alerting when available disk space is low, which could cause system slowdowns or crashes.
4)Network Activity Monitoring: Monitors network bandwidth usage and identifies any unusual network traffic that might indicate issues.

**Log Generation and Collection:**

The monitoring system generates logs periodically and stores them in a dedicated directory (/home/chiranjeet/Custom_shell_scripts/system_monitoring/hardware_monitoring/logs/).
These logs contain important information regarding system health, including metrics on CPU, memory, disk, and network performance.

**Automated Email Alerts:**

mailx is used to send email alerts whenever any system resource exceeds the defined threshold. For example, an alert might be triggered when CPU usage exceeds 90%, or available memory falls below 10%.
The emails are sent to a configured email address (e.g., chiranjeetdas73@gmail.com) and include the relevant system performance data.
The subject of the email is customizable, e.g., "System Monitoring Data", to ensure the recipient understands the content immediately.

1) Email Configuration with mailx:

The system uses mailx for sending the alerts via email. The user configures the email settings in their system to include their SMTP server information.
The mailx utility allows sending messages directly from the command line, making it a simple and efficient tool for sending system alerts.

2) Scheduled Execution:

The system monitoring scripts are scheduled to run periodically, allowing continuous monitoring without manual intervention. This is achieved using a background task scheduler such as cron.
The periodic execution ensures real-time monitoring and timely detection of system performance issues.

 # Technologies Used

1)Bash Shell Scripting: Used to create the monitoring scripts and automate the entire process of log collection and alerting.
2)Linux Command Line Utilities: Tools like ps, top, df, free, vmstat, ifconfig, and others are used to monitor system parameters.
3)mailx: A command-line email client that sends the monitoring data via email.
4)System Scheduling: cron is used to schedule periodic execution of the monitoring and alerting scripts.

# How It Works

1) Initialization:

The system begins by initializing scripts that monitor various system resources (CPU, memory, disk space, network activity). These scripts run continuously, collecting data over time.

2) Log Collection:

Each monitoring script collects the relevant system data and appends it to specific log files. For example, the CPU monitoring script writes CPU usage data to a cpu_monitor.log file, and the memory usage data is written to a memory_monitor.log file.

3) Threshold Check:

The alerting_mechanism.sh script reads the log files at regular intervals, checking if any of the monitored parameters exceed predefined thresholds (e.g., 90% CPU usage, 80% disk usage).

4)Triggering Alerts:

If a critical value is detected, the alerting_mechanism.sh script triggers an email alert using mailx. The script sends the contents of the logs (or a summary) to the configured email address.

5)Email Notification:

The email alert is sent with a subject like "System Monitoring Data", and it includes details about the system’s health, such as CPU usage, available memory, disk usage, and network activity.
This ensures that the user is immediately informed about critical system conditions.

 # System Monitoring Continuation:

The system continues running in the background, monitoring resources and sending alerts as necessary. Users can periodically check the logs for further insights into system health.

**Benefits**

1)Proactive Issue Detection: The system ensures that users are notified about system performance issues, allowing them to take corrective actions before problems become critical.
2)Automated Alerts: The system runs automatically, providing timely alerts without requiring manual checks or constant monitoring.
3)Email Integration: Using mailx, alerts are directly sent to the user’s email inbox, ensuring quick and efficient communication.
4)Log Management: Centralized log storage makes it easier for users to review and analyze historical performance data for troubleshooting.

 # Possible Extensions/Improvements

1) Real-time Dashboards: Implement a real-time dashboard using tools like Grafana or Prometheus for advanced monitoring and visualization.
2) Customizable Alerts: Provide users with the ability to customize the thresholds at which alerts are triggered.
3) SMS Alerts: Integrate SMS services like Twilio to send text message alerts in addition to emails for users who prefer SMS notifications.
4) Advanced Log Analysis: Implement more sophisticated log parsing and analysis to provide insights into trends and potential future issues.
